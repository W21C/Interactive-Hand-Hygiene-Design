# Interactive-Hand-Hygiene-Design

This project builds on code written by the Emily Carr University of Art + Design and Vancouver Coastal Health.

This QI project uses Xbees embedded into hand sanitizers to track usage of hand sanitizers on a hospital unit. Data collected will be contrasted with traditional observation based audits for hand hygiene compliance. The Xbees communicate with a Processing sketch via an arduino and serial communication.
