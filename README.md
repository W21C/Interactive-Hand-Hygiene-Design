## Project Background

This repository contains the hardware and software specifications neccesary to retrofit hand hygiene dispensers to capture real-time, continuous data and display that information with interactive design.  

## Collaboration

Emily Carr University of Art + Design's Health Design Lab developed the original software and hardware to promote hand hygiene compliance through interaction design in collaboration with Vancouver Coastal Health. W21C leveraged the existing technology, and modified the hardware to create networked hand hygiene dispensers to implement onto a medical teaching unit at Foothills Medical Center (Calgary, Alberta), with the goal of promoting hand hygiene compliance. 

## Tech Details

The most recent W21C project uses Xbees embedded into hand hygiene dispensers to track usage of hand hygiene dispensers on a hospital unit. The Xbees communicate with a Processing sketch via an arduino and serial communication.

Software Folder: Processing code for recording and visualizing dispenser use.

Hardware Folder: Specifications for networked hand hygiene dispensers using Xbees and Arduinos, as well as a parts list that includes video terminals and computing. 

## Impact and Efficacy

A Quality Improvement project by W21C at Foothills Medical Center produced results that indicate interaction design successfully increases hand hygiene compliance and that frequency of use of the modified hand hygiene dispensers correlates with hand hygiene compliance. 

## Objectives

Share and promote the improvement and dissemination of this freely available hardware and software, this social innovation demonstrates the potential to increase hand hygiene compliance and innovation in healthcare and everywhere else !
