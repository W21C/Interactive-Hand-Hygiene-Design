W21C Hand Hygiene QI project Unit 36
==================

This project builds on code written by the Emily Carr University of Art + Design and Vancouver Coastal Health. 

This QI project uses Xbees embedded into hand sanitizers to track usage of hand sanitizers on a hospital unit. Data collected will be contrasted with traditional observation based audits for hand hygiene compliance.
The Xbees communicate with a Processing sketch via an arduino and serial communication.
