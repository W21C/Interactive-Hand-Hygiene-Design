This folder contains the hardware specifications neccasary to retrofit hand hygiene dispensers for interaction design. 


Fritzing - design of the  electronics hardware

PCB schematics - graphical representation of the electrical circuit

Functional Breakdown - support to build the modified hand hygiene dispensers

Parts list - all of the hardware components (i.e., Xbees, arduinos, batterypacks, CPU) used to build wirless Xbee networks 
and display the data on TV monitors. 

Xbee Migration - guide to  assist you with migrating from the XBee/XBee-PRO ZB (S2/S2B) to the XBee/XBee-PRO ZB
(S2C) Through-Hole modules.

Switch Integration - The switch used in the current version was plastered onto the hand hygiene dispenser with sugru. 
Our team would recommend creatively constructing an alternative to our 'switch and sugru' solution. Have fun !
